Projects to help the aftertime
this my first attempt at working with github and ghidra
I hope to engage student engineers to work here on project of there choosing once
I have had some time to learn the system.
my nome de plume is doQ17 and aftertime projects is a fanciful look into life after 
some disasterous durure event the hampers central links to interenet and only local 
networks with disparate front end systems are available to communicate via 
wireless networks that are  somehow configured ien a dasychain fashion to get wider reach
the trick will be to allow access to the wireless network and still configure your
private nodes in your home or whatever.
