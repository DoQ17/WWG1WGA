Projects to help the aftertime: this my first attempt at working with github and ghidra

My nome de plume is doQ17 and aftertime projects is a fanciful look into life after some 
disasterous event that hampers central links to interenet and only local networks with disparate
front end systems are available to communicate via wireless networks that are somehow configured
in a daisychain fashion to get wider reach. The trick will be to allow access to the wireless 
network and still configure your private nodes in your home or whatever.

I am a retired research engineer with a PhD in Systems Engineering.
I have 33 years working at a Naional Lab.
I now teach a Fundamentals of Engineering Lab I & II part time as adjunct aculty.
I hope to engage student engineers to work here on project of there choosing once
I have had some time to learn the system.
