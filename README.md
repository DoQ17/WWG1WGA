Projects to help the aftertime: athis my first attempt to work with github & ghidra

My nome de plume is doQ17 and aftertime projects is a fanciful look into life after some 
disasterous event that hampers central links to interenet and only local networks with disparate
front end systems are available to communicate via wireless networks that are somehow configured
in a daisychain fashion to get wider reach. The trick will be to allow access to the wireless 
network and still configure your private nodes in your home or whatever.
